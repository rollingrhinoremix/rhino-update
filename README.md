# Rhino Update
Rhino Update is a command-line utility script which will provide updates to items that do not hit the Ubuntu devel repositories, such as the latest Linux Kernel.

This command-line utility is preferred over using `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` as it is able to provide new features that would not be available through the official Ubuntu repositories. Furthermore any major changes to the Linux distribution itself will occur via this utility as opposed to apt.
